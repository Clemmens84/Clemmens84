- 👋 Hi, I’m @Clemmens84

- 👀 I’m very interested in C programming, whether for simple tasks, Windows programs or embedded systems.
I have some interest in games, art, music, and miscellaneous programming languages, as well as basic web development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C. Always trying to get better at C. 
But I'm also reading up on Python (at W3 schools) after having read Java, C++, and Lua textbooks or primers.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my superficial ecological balance simulation dressed as a Windows program written in C. (It's meant for eventual use in a game.)
I would also like to find opportunities to strengthen competence in C.

- 📫 How to reach me ... you can email me at alex.clemmens@gmail.com.
